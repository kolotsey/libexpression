LIBEXPRESSION - library that provides a mechanism for solving math expressions
==============================================================================

Overview
--------

  Libexpression library provides a mechanism for solving valid math and logical
  expressions for other programs. It is intended to allow programmers to
  integrate a user-frielndly calculators/expressions into their programs.

  Libexpression is based on RPN algorithm with several powerful modifications,
  such as trinary operators, variable arguments functions and user defined
  callbacks.

  Almost all functions in the library are thread-safe. All non thread-safe
  functions have their thread-safe analogs. Please, refer to the example below
  to see how to use this library.

Requirements
------------

  This library does not require any extra packages.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

  The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd` to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure` to configure the package for your system. While running,
     `configure` prints some messages telling which features it is
     checking for. There are many options which you may provide to configure
     (which you can discover by running configure with the --help option).

  2. Type `make` to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install` to install the programs, libraries and any data files
     and documentation.

Documentation
-------------

  The library is distributed with detailed documentation. The documentation
  in HTML format is stored in sub-folder named `doc`.

Example
-------

  See file expression.c. To build this file, run
    `gcc -lexpression -o expression expression.c` 
  in console.
